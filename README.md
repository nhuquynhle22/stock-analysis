# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project
There are so many different clean energies to invest in. Steve wants to help his parents figure out which company to invest in, and if they are investing in the right one. An analysis on a selection of stocks will help Steve and his parents figure out which company to invest in. Analysis was done via Excel using VBA macros to examine and go through all the stocks. The purpose of the analysis is to provide and compare the stock's permformace thorughout the years, so they can know how to invest in the future.

## Results
After running the VBA macros and codes it can be seen that in 2017 mostly all the stock returns hit a postive reutrn, except for stock TERP who hada -7.2% return. Since Steve's parents invested in DQ they should know it was one that had one of the biggest reutrns coming in with a +199% return that year. Since they to have invested with DQ they made back their money and almost doubled it within that year. 

While on the other hand, in 2018 the stock return isn't has lucky as 2017. Almost all of the stocks except had a negative return, except for two ENPH adn RUN who both had around +80-85% return. Since Steve's parents invested in DQ they should know it had a -62.6% return that year. After the two years Steve's parents would make a +30-35% return for DQ.

After examing the two reutrn years for the stocks, Steve should recommend to his parents the stocks ENPH and RUN due to their continual positive return rate during the two years. Although DQ did have a very high return in 2017, investing in multiple stocks might yield a better return for his parents.  

## Summary
Refactoring code always has its ups and downs. The main advantages of refactoring would be that , the code is fresher, easier to understand or read, less complex and easier to maintain. It will definitely lower the technical debt and may even increase performance. It'll also reduces bugs in code by catching them. On the other hand, the disadvantages of refactoring would be having no idea how much time it may take to complete the process. It may also land you into a situation where you have no idea where to go. Not only will it be time consuming, but if it does go wrong you will waste time tryng to find and solve the problem.

The refactored code for the stock analysis was in our favor. The advantage to refacotring the orginal VBA script was that it was able to run for a shorter and faster amount of time, since we created a tickerIndex variable with three output arrays. The disadvantage for me was knowing how to wrtie it in and where it belonged so it ran smoothly with no bugs.
